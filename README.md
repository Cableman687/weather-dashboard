# Weather Dashboard

## Description

- The motivation to complete this challenge was to test my own skills gained in the most recent week of the coding bootcamp, including but not limited to; API Fetch Commands, API Data Management and Utility, Network Activity Analysis, Server Communication & Others.
- This project was built as a testing ground for my own retention of the aforementioned skills.
- This application solves the problem of accuratate weather forecasting for the user, using a clean and responsive UI.
- Through building this application, I learnt that there are many programming skills outside of what we learn throughout the week, and that research and collaboration is critical in order to achieve the best outcome for any given project.
